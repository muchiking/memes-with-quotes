I used to think I was indecisive. But now I’m not so sure.,
Russian dolls are so full of themselves.,
The easiest time to add insult to injury is when you’re signing someone’s cast.,
My therapist says I have a preoccupation for revenge. We’ll see about that,
"People who use selfie sticks really need to have a good, long look at themselves.",
"Two fish are in a tank. One says, ‘How do you drive this thing?’",
The last thing I want to do is hurt you; but it’s still on the list.,
Atheism is a non-prophet organization.,
A recent study has found that women who carry a little extra weight live longer than the men who mention it.,
"The future, the present, and the past walk into a bar. Things got a little tense",
Blunt pencils are really pointless.,
Refusing to go to the gym is a form of resistance training.,
"If attacked by a mob of clowns, go for the juggler.",
The man who invented Velcro has died. RIP,
"If you don’t pay your exorcist, do you get repossessed?",
