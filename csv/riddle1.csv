Which is heavier: a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers?,
"Sara has four daughters, and each of her daughters has a brother. How many children does Sara have?",
"If your uncle’s sister is not your aunt, what relation is she to you?",
"What belongs to you, but everyone else uses it.",
"No matter how little or how much you use me, you change me every month. What am I?",
"You walk into a room that contains a match, a kerosene lamp, a candle, and a fireplace. What would you light first?",
"Spelled forwards I’m what you do every day, spelled backward I’m something you hate. What am I?",
